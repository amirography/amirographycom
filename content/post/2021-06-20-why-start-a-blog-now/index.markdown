I was one of the first few hundred bloggers in my country. I began blogging when I was 13, close to 15 years ago. Nevertheless, I have never been able to blog consistently. Until recently, I did not feel any pressure to blog consistently, since I considered blogging to be "always there".Even if I did, I didn't bring anything unique to the table. 

Three to four years ago, when I finally saw all my inquiries converge, I started to agonize over the decline of personal blogging. There seems to be a consensus across all circles that blogging platforms are obsolete, and starting a new blog is a waste of time and energy at best.

Despite that, I now have something to contribute -however small-, and platforms which dominate the attention economy of former blogging spheres aren't compatible with the longer-than-280-characters essays that will be needed to explain my ideas.

In the present day, there are more formal platforms available, such as journal articles. However, that solution comes with some catches. They are twofold:
1. The majority of journal articles are rarely read.
2. As writing journal articles can be a challenging, frustrating task (as I will argue they should be most of the time), this leaves room for a more nuanced development process that comes before publishing in philosophy and science. In cases where one has someone who can review and critique their work (as my supervisor and advisor did for my thesis), one may not need to sketch. The reality is that my interests extend far beyond my thesis, and I see it as just a piece of the puzzle. Therefore, a sandboxing area would be more than useful. 

Recently, I listened to a podcast called Bayes' Factor from [Human Interaction lab](https://sites.tufts.edu/hilab/), in which Alexander Etz and JP De Ruiter discussed benefits of blogging. They argued that blogging can be advantageous if you have a niche.

That prompted me to check out a few other blogs, particularly active in the science world. [Lesslikely](https://lesslikely.com/) blog attracted my attention, since it was filled with rich content but of much more interest to me technologically. As it was made incorporating Rmarkdown. A tool which I always had an interest in.

The RMarkdown package consists of tools created by and for the R statistical programming language. I've been trying to learn R for a while, but since I've yet to gather data of my own, I didn't know how to integrate R into my daily life so that I could learn the syntax and learn the environment. Finding Lesslikely was a happy discovery in my growing interest in both blogging and learning R at the same time. 

My yesterday was spent like that. 

Today, I post this first unremarkable essay, as a way of breaking the ice. Moving forward, my efforts will be more substantial.
